# About Me

I am a Front-End Developer seeking full time work. I am also open to teaching oppuritunities. I completed a bootcamp called Chingu where I worked with a remote team from different time zones I also volunteer for Code for Philly, TechGirlz, and Philly Tech Sistas .

I have experience in HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, and GatsbyJS. Through my self-taught journey, I 've learned to grasp concepts quickly and adapt to different situations.
