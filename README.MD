# Updates!

#### 01/17/2022

I am no longer actively pursuing a career in tech. I will still do this as a hobby every once in awhile. 

Thank you to the people who tried to help me get a job in tech and a big ol' fat one to those who never wanted me in tech to begin with.

# About Me

I am a Front-End Developer seeking full time work. I am also open to teaching oppuritunities. I completed a bootcamp called Chingu where I worked with a remote team from different time zones I also volunteer for Code for Philly, TechGirlz, and Philly Tech Sistas .

I have experience in HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, and GatsbyJS. Through my self-taught journey, I 've learned to grasp concepts quickly and adapt to different situations.
